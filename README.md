## My Thought Process 

The creation of the design was simple and easy, the hard part came to when I had to find a way to do the operations. The method I came up with was by adding each number and operator used to a variable and doing calculations with that. 

## My Troubles

It was hard to figure out how to exactly do the calculations, and also how to make them stay consistent with the different ways that a calculator can be used.
